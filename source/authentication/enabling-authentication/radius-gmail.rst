RADIUS Authentication using Gmail Credentials
=============================================

The most common method to WiFi authentication is having a shared SSID and passphrase. 
Shared SSID and passphrase authentication can be effective at keeping the majority of unauthorized users at bay, 
but it doesnâ€™t offer the ability to easily control who is accessing your WiFi network because anyone with the 
SSID and passphrase essentially has full access.
Genian NAC RADIUS server can eliminate shared passphrases by creating unique access to your WiFi for each person on your network using Gmail credentials.
